To do:
- fix underline in menu item - done // getBoundingClientRect changed to offsetLeft (probably unnecessary - error was because of style/js loading order) //
- fix width of underline at start / width 40 should be 46 / - done //  js was loading before css. Adding window.onload into DOMContentLoaded fixed the problem //
- underline moves depending on section - done // using offsetHeight, value of the end of the page is provided, that allows to trigger contact underline //
- padding in subscribe - done // added prefixes to handle all browsers //
- lower resolution of pictures
- make css for scroll for ff and ie
- sliders - done // one function supports all sliders ;) //
- overlay for pictures hover - done
- mobile version
- add autoprefixer - done
- W3C Validation - done
- in section "story about us" add counter for digits - working on it...
- add alt's to img - done
- note for future projects - use more img instead of background-image of div's
- added "use strict" to script.js
